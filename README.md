# CastleInTheSky-VR
A 3D Visualization of Laputa the "Castle in the Sky" from the movie with the same name. Whenever I watch the main characters exploring the Castle in the Sky, I can imagine myself creating each pillar and fields in a 3D Engine and walking through it myself. Moving what I know about 3DS MAX into Unreal Engine and later VR (long-term personal project)

**Note: The current version of this project is made in Unreal 5.6 and is INCREDIBLY unoptimized. I'll probably get to working on optimization once I got the core features of this exploration game finished and its more polished**

(Many thanks to Skyslide for their 3D Models which make up most of Laputa post-2023
    
# Misc. Portfolio Renders
  
Although I didn't take the professional 3D Modeling / Rigging / Animation path, I have continued it as a hobby. One of the renders I've worked on is the Flapter from the Castle in the Sky movie, pictured below. Pictured after the flapter is Benny the Spaceman from the LEGO movie.
